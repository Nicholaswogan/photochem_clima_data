# water_continuum

This directory contains opacities approximating the "water continuum" absorption.

**`MT_CKD.h5`** contains opacities computed with the [MT_CKD v3.5 model](https://github.com/AER-RC/MT_CKD/tree/72c0c0dccb2caec13c3b7e278b28f1301d95edfc). I also cast these opacities as H2O-H2O and H2O-N2 CIA, which are in the `CIA/` folder. The `notes` dataset in the h5 files contains the units of all dataset.
