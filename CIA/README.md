# CIA

The following CIA cross sections come from the [petitRADTRANS](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201935470) database. They got these cross section from the [Hitran website](https://hitran.org/cia/), but interpolated them to a regular grid:

- CH4-CH4
- CO2-CO2
- H2-CH4
- H2-H2
- H2-He
- N2-N2
- N2-O2
- O2-O2

These CIA are directly from the [Hitran website](https://hitran.org/cia/), but I interpolated them to a regular grid:

- CO2-CH4
- CO2-H2
- N2-H2

These CIA are representations of the MT_CKD v3.5 H2O and foreign continuum:
- H2O-H2O
- H2O-N2
